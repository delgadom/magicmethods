## History: ##

This site is a friendly fork of @RafeKettler's excelent guide, currently available in this [repo](https://github.com/RafeKettler/magicmethods). The latest version of the site is hosted at https://delgadom.github.io/magicmethods. PRs are welcome, and a request that this work be subsumed back into RafeKettler's original repo would be even more welcome.

## For forkers: ##
Edit `magicmethods.markdown`/`magicmethods.tex`, then run `make docs`. The build script requires the Python Markdown module, so you'll have to run `pip install markdown` if you don't already have it. Happy hacking!
